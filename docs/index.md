# Gravatar

## What is the Gravatar

```An "avatar" is an image that represents you onlineâ€”a little picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites.

A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar. You upload it and create your profile just once, and then when you participate in any Gravatar-enabled site, your Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.

Gravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users. It is automatically included in every [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com) account and is run and supported by [Automattic](https://automattic.com).```
